# hardware-demo

This repo is intended to provide integrators with a better understanding of GEOTAB's add-on protocols. Each folder in the repo is dedicated to a different protocol, with each containing a program version that can be used with hardware and another which is purely demonstrative. Regardless of the version being used, by running these programs, integrators will be able to observe the bytes and byte order required to send various types of messages to GEOTAB devices.
